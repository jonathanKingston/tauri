# Servo patches

Patches this runtime needs on top of the Servo revision pinned in
`Cargo.toml`, each one a candidate upstream PR. This directory is the record;
the *applied* form lives on a fork branch that the pin points at.

## Workflow

1. Fork servo and branch from the pinned rev:
   `git clone https://github.com/servo/servo && git checkout -b tauri-runtime-patches f4dde27`
2. `git am servo-patches/*.patch`
3. Push the branch to the fork and point `Cargo.toml`'s `servo` dependency at
   it: `servo = { version = "0.4.0", git = "https://github.com/<fork>/servo.git", rev = "<tip>" }`
4. Submit each patch upstream; when one merges, advance the pin past it and
   delete the file here.

Consumers can also try a patch without a runtime release by checking servo
out locally, applying the series, and adding to their workspace root:

```toml
[patch."https://github.com/servo/servo.git"]
servo = { path = "../servo/components/servo" }
```

## Current series

- **0001 — Honor embedder-registered secure schemes in secure-context checks.**
  `ProtocolHandler::is_secure()` was honored by the fetch layer but not by
  script's `GlobalScope::is_secure_context()`, because a non-special scheme's
  opaque origin can never be "potentially trustworthy" — so `[SecureContext]`
  APIs (`crypto.randomUUID`, `crypto.subtle`, …) were absent on
  custom-protocol pages like `tauri://localhost`. Registers secure schemes
  from the merged `ProtocolRegistry` into `servo_url` at startup and consults
  them in `ServoUrl::is_potentially_trustworthy`. The related CSP gap
  (`'self'` never matches an opaque origin) is *not* addressed here.
  *Validated end-to-end on Linux*: with this patch and the randomUUID
  polyfill disabled, the Copse renderer's id-minting boot path (previously
  dead without the polyfill) works on the native API under
  `tauri://localhost`.

- **0002 — script: support user input in contenteditable elements.**
  Cherry-picked from the fork branch `codex/contenteditable-user-input`
  (authored 2026-08-02); applies cleanly to the pinned rev. Routes keyboard
  input into `contenteditable` roots in
  `document_event_handler.rs` — the gap that made rich-text composers
  (e.g. Copse's chip editor) unable to accept typing under Servo.
  *Validated end-to-end on Linux*: typing into the Copse composer, pressing
  Send, and receiving a model reply all work in the Servo UI with this
  applied. Known issue: under synthetic X11 input (xdotool), shift-wrapped
  characters double-insert ("T" becomes "TT"); needs a real-keyboard repro
  to attribute (patch logic vs key-event delivery) before fixing.
